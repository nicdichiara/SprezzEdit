SprezzEdit
==========

SprezzEdit is a client-side webapp providing SublimeText style live web development.<br />
Test is out in it's current alpha state at http://nickdichiara.com/sprezzedit


When I started this project I had three motivations:<br />
1. I wanted SublimeText as a webapp so I could work from any computer.<br />
2. I was terrible at JS and wanted to get better & learn by taking on a big project.<br />
3. I was tired of constantly doing *Save*, *Go to Chrome*, *Refresh*, *Observe Changes*, *Save*, *Go to Chrome*........x9000.

I would love some ideas, and feedback from anyone who would be interested in something like this. 


I have just uploaded it, so there is a lot left to be cleaned up. I am a student and also work so forgive me if I slack behind when these take higher priority. 

A big thanks to the awesome work being done over at:<br />
[CodeMirror](https://github.com/marijnh/codemirror)
-This is an excellent text editiing and code coloring platform that has saved me many headaches.<br /> 
[Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
-Needs no introduction, Bootstrap makes prototyping and development super easy and quick.<br />
[jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
-Also needs no introduction, JQuery is a very powerful javascript library.<br />

Also thanks to [NoxArt](https://github.com/NoxArt) for helping me decide to push this out to the public and get the ball rolling.
